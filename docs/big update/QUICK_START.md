# ✅ Implementation Complete - Quick Start Guide

## 🎉 What's Been Implemented

All 5 collaboration features are now ready:

1. ✅ **Activity Logs** - Complete audit trail system
2. ✅ **Labels** - Task categorization with 18 predefined colors
3. ✅ **Comments** - Discussion threads with @mentions and pagination
4. ✅ **Attachments** - File uploads via Supabase (2-step flow)
5. ✅ **Project Members** - Team collaboration with role-based access (OWNER, ADMIN, MEMBER, VIEWER)

**Total:** 27 new API endpoints, 40+ files, fully documented.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Do These Now)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration (REQUIRED)

```bash
# Connect to your Neon database and run migration
psql "your-neon-connection-string" -f prisma/migrations/manual_add_project_members.sql
```

**What this does:**
- Creates `project_members` table
- Creates `project_role` enum (OWNER, ADMIN, MEMBER, VIEWER)
- Auto-migrates existing PERSONAL projects (adds workspace members to projects)

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Should return 4 rows
SELECT enumlabel FROM pg_enum WHERE enumtypid = 'project_role'::regtype;

-- Should show member count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM project_members;
```

### Step 2: Regenerate Prisma Client

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### Step 3: Rebuild Application

```bash
npm run build
```

Expected: Build completes successfully ✅

### Step 4: Test Basic Endpoints

**Using your HTTP client (Postman, Thunder Client, etc.):**

```http
### 1. Create a workspace label
POST http://localhost:3000/workspaces/{{workspaceId}}/labels
Authorization: Bearer {{your-jwt-token}}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Bug",
  "color": "red",
  "description": "Bug fixes"
}

### 2. Create a comment on a task
POST http://localhost:3000/tasks/{{taskId}}/comments
Authorization: Bearer {{your-jwt-token}}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "content": "This is a test comment with @[user-uuid] mention"
}

### 3. Request attachment upload URL
POST http://localhost:3000/tasks/{{taskId}}/attachments/upload-url
Authorization: Bearer {{your-jwt-token}}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "fileName": "screenshot.png",
  "fileSize": 1024000,
  "mimeType": "image/png"
}

### 4. List project members
GET http://localhost:3000/projects/{{projectId}}/members
Authorization: Bearer {{your-jwt-token}}
```

## 🎯 API Endpoint Quick Reference

### Labels (7 endpoints)
```
POST   /workspaces/:workspaceId/labels          Create label
GET    /workspaces/:workspaceId/labels          List workspace labels
PATCH  /labels/:labelId                         Update label

```

### Comments (4 endpoints)
```

GET    /tasks/:taskId/comments                  List comments (paginated)
PATCH  /comments/:commentId                     Update comment
DELETE /comments/:commentId                     Delete comment
```

### Attachments (4 endpoints)
```

GET    /tasks/:taskId/attachments              List attachments
GET    /attachments/:attachmentId/view-url     Get view URL
DELETE /attachments/:attachmentId              Delete attachment
```

### Project Members (5 endpoints)

```

## ⚙️ Configuration Constants

### Labels
```typescript
import { LABEL_COLORS, MAX_LABELS_PER_TASK } from '@/common/constants';

// 18 predefined colors (Tailwind palette)
LABEL_COLORS // Array of {name, hex, bg}

// Max 5 labels per task
MAX_LABELS_PER_TASK // 5
```

### Attachments
```typescript
import { ATTACHMENT_LIMITS } from '@/common/constants';

ATTACHMENT_LIMITS.maxFileSize // 10MB (10485760 bytes)
ATTACHMENT_LIMITS.maxFilesPerTask // 20
ATTACHMENT_LIMITS.allowedMimeTypes // 28 types (images, docs, archives, etc.)
```

## 🔐 Important Business Rules

### Labels
- ✅ Max 5 labels per task
- ✅ Color must be from predefined palette (18 colors)
- ✅ Workspace-scoped (shared across all projects)
- ✅ No duplicate names in same workspace

### Comments
- ✅ Max 5000 characters per comment
- ✅ @Mentions format: `@[user-uuid]`
- ✅ Cursor-based pagination (limit 1-100, default 20)
- ✅ Only author can update/delete

### Attachments
- ✅ Max 10MB per file (conservative for Supabase free tier)
- ✅ Max 20 files per task
- ✅ 28 allowed MIME types (images, docs, spreadsheets, etc.)
- ✅ 2-step upload: Request URL → Upload to Supabase → Auto-save to DB

### Project Members
- ✅ Email search only (user must exist in DB)
- ✅ TEAM projects only (PERSONAL uses workspace memberships)
- ✅ Cannot remove last OWNER
- ✅ OWNER/ADMIN can invite, only OWNER can change roles

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Errors After Migration
```bash
# Regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Clear build cache
rm -rf dist/
npm run build
```

### "project_members does not exist"
**Cause:** Migration not run yet  
**Fix:** See Step 1 above (run migration script)

### "User not found with email: xxx"
**Cause:** Trying to invite non-existent user  
**Fix:** User must sign up first (no email invitations sent)

### "Can only invite members to TEAM projects"
**Cause:** Trying to invite to PERSONAL project  
**Fix:** Convert project to TEAM first:
```http
POST /projects/:projectId/convert-to-team
{ "keepCurrentMembers": true }
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Before Production
1. **Supabase Limits:**
   - Free tier: 1GB storage, 2GB/month bandwidth
   - Consider upgrading for production
   - Monitor usage in Supabase dashboard

2. **Performance:**
   - Add Redis cache for activity feeds (if > 1000 records)
   - Monitor database query performance
   - Consider CDN for attachment delivery

3. **Security:**
   - All endpoints use JWT authentication ✅
   - File upload validation in place ✅
   - Role-based access control ✅
   - Consider rate limiting for uploads

4. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for services
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints
   - Load test pagination with large datasets

### Known Limitations
- No email notifications for @mentions (NotificationsService placeholder)
- No email invites for members (email search only)
- No thumbnail generation for images
- Activity feed not optimized for very large datasets (> 10,000 records)

## 📞 Support

### If Something Doesn't Work

1. **Check migration:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM project_members; -- Should return > 0
   ```

2. **Regenerate Prisma:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   # Look for errors in console
   ```

4. **Verify JWT token:**
   - Check expiration
   - Ensure user exists in database
