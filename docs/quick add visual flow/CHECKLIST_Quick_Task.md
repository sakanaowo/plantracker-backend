## üß™ Manual Testing Checklist

### Happy Path Tests

- [ ] **Test 1: Create quick task with title only**
  ```
  POST /tasks/quick
  { "title": "Buy groceries" }
  Expected: 201 Created + task object
  ```

- [ ] **Test 2: Create quick task with title and description**
  ```
  POST /tasks/quick
  { "title": "Buy groceries", "description": "Milk, eggs" }
  Expected: 201 Created + task object with description
  ```

- [ ] **Test 3: Verify task appears in TODO board**
  ```
  GET /tasks/by-board/{boardId}
  Expected: List includes the created task
  ```

- [ ] **Test 4: Verify task is auto-assigned to creator**
  ```
  Check task.assignee_id === current user ID
  ```

### Error Path Tests

- [ ] **Test 5: Missing title**
  ```
  POST /tasks/quick
  { "description": "Test" }
  Expected: 400 Bad Request
  ```

- [ ] **Test 6: Empty title**
  ```
  POST /tasks/quick
  { "title": "" }
  Expected: 400 Bad Request
  ```

- [ ] **Test 7: No authentication token**
  ```
  POST /tasks/quick (no auth header)
  Expected: 401 Unauthorized
  ```

- [ ] **Test 8: Invalid token**
  ```
  POST /tasks/quick (invalid auth header)
  Expected: 401 Unauthorized
  ```

- [ ] **Test 9: User with no workspace**
  ```
  Expected: 404 Not Found - "Personal workspace not found"
  Note: This should rarely happen in production
  ```

- [ ] **Test 10: User with no projects**
  ```
  Expected: 404 Not Found - "No projects found"
  Note: This should rarely happen in production
  ```

### Edge Case Tests

- [ ] **Test 11: Multiple projects (verify uses first)**
  ```
  User has 3 projects created at different times
  Expected: Task created in earliest project
  ```

- [ ] **Test 12: No TODO board (verify uses first board)**
  ```
  User's project has no board named "To Do"
  Expected: Task created in first board by order
  ```

- [ ] **Test 13: Board with many tasks (position calculation)**
  ```
  Board already has 100 tasks
  Expected: New task has position > last task
  ```

- [ ] **Test 14: Concurrent requests**
  ```
  Send 5 simultaneous requests
  Expected: All 5 tasks created successfully with different positions
  ```

- [ ] **Test 15: Special characters in title**
  ```
  POST /tasks/quick
  { "title": "Buy ‚òïÔ∏è & üçï" }
  Expected: 201 Created with emoji preserved
  ```

### Performance Tests

- [ ] **Test 16: Response time < 200ms**
  ```
  Measure average response time over 100 requests
  Expected: < 200ms
  ```

- [ ] **Test 17: Database connection pool**
  ```
  Send 50 concurrent requests
  Expected: All succeed without connection timeout
  ```

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: "Personal workspace not found"
**Symptoms**: User gets 404 error when creating quick task
**Diagnosis**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM workspaces 
WHERE owner_id = '<user-id>' AND type = 'PERSONAL';
```
**Solutions**:
- Run workspace creation logic for this user
- Check if default workspace creation is working on signup

#### Issue 2: "No projects found"
**Symptoms**: User has workspace but no projects
**Diagnosis**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM projects 
WHERE workspace_id = '<workspace-id>';
```
**Solutions**:
- Run default project creation for this workspace
- Check if default project creation is working

#### Issue 3: "No boards found"
**Symptoms**: User has project but no boards
**Diagnosis**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM boards 
WHERE project_id = '<project-id>';
```
**Solutions**:
- Create default boards for this project
- Check if board creation is working

#### Issue 4: Slow response time
**Symptoms**: Response time > 500ms
**Diagnosis**:
- Check database query performance
- Check connection pool utilization
- Check network latency
**Solutions**:
- Add/optimize database indexes
- Increase connection pool size
- Cache workspace/project lookups

#### Issue 5: Position conflicts
**Symptoms**: Multiple tasks have same position
**Diagnosis**:
```sql
SELECT position, COUNT(*) 
FROM tasks 
WHERE board_id = '<board-id>' 
GROUP BY position 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
**Solutions**:
- Re-calculate positions for affected board
- Add transaction isolation if needed
